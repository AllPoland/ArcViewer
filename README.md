# ArcViewer
An open source 3D Beat Saber map previewer, designed to give users an accurate representation of Beat Saber maps in a quick, easy to use application

## Features
- **Quickly load maps** from local zips/directories, direct URLs, or BeatSaver IDs and links

- **Game-accurate visuals** with properly recreated proportions and spawn animations

- **V3 map support** including arcs, chains, angle offset (diagonal dots), V3 wall shenanigans, and official BPM changes

- **Highly customizable** with a range of settings to modify hitsounds, graphics, visuals, and camera settings

## Planned Features
These features aren't included yet, but are very likely to be added in the future.

- Support for precision placement/rotation through mapping/noodle extensions

- 360/90 degree gamemode support (currently just displays as a regular map without rotation events)

- Overriding NJS and JD

- Basic lighting support (V1 and V2 events on a single environment)

- Basic chroma and custom color support (note and light colors, chroma color events)

## Unplanned Features
These features aren't included, and most likely never will be. If you ask for these I will unceremoniously tell you no.

- Advanced heck support (this includes things like enviroment enhancements/removal, track animations, etc.)

- Error checking beyond things that make maps unloadable (ArcViewer is a previewer, not map checking software)

- Gameplay. This should be self explanatory

- Removing start screen watermark (this costs money :fw_nofwoompdespair)

## Get Started
ArcViewer is currently only available as a desktop application. A browser port is in-progress, but for now, simply download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/AllPoland/ArcViewer/releases) page and unzip the contents to a new folder.

## For Developers
ArcViewer is developed in Unity version 2021.3.20

Development and build guides will be written to help contributors ~~when I feel like it~~ soon:tm:.
