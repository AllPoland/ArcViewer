# ArcViewer
An open source 3D Beat Saber map previewer, designed to give users an accurate representation of Beat Saber maps in a quick, easy to use application

## Features
- **Quickly load maps** from local zips/directories, direct URLs, or BeatSaver IDs and links

- **View Replays** from local/online .bsor files, or BeatLeader score IDs

- **Game-accurate visuals** with properly recreated proportions and spawn animations

- **V3 map support** including arcs, chains, angle offset (diagonal dots), V3 wall shenanigans, and official BPM changes

- **Lighting support** including V1 and V2 lighting events, represented on one environment

- **Highly customizable** with a range of settings to modify hitsounds, graphics, visuals, and camera settings

- **Custom colors** from each map's environment, mapper set colors, or your own customizable colors

- **Adjustable playback** including options to change playback speed and jump settings

- **Chroma support** with Chroma colored light events and objects, as well as lightID, Chroma ring spins/zooms, and Chroma laser speed events

- **Basic modded map support** displaying precision placement through Mapping Extensions and Noodle Extensions

## Unplanned Features
These features aren't included, and most likely never will be. If you ask for these I will unceremoniously tell you no.

- Advanced heck support (this includes things like enviroment enhancements/removal, track animations, etc.)

- Error checking beyond things that make maps unloadable (ArcViewer is a previewer, not map checking software)

- Gameplay. This should be self explanatory

- Removing start screen watermark (this costs money :fw_nofwoompdespair)
